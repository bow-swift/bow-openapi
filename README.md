**Bow OpenAPI** is a command-line tool to generate a Swift network client from an OpenAPI / Swagger specification file. Please, refer to the [project website](https://openapi.bow-swift.io) for extensive and detailed documentation about the project.

### Features

üí° Automatic generation of network clients written in Swift from an OpenAPI / Swagger specification file, in YAML or JSON formats.

üì¶ Provision of a Swift Package that can be consumed from Swift Package Manager.

üî® Integration with Xcode as a build phase to always keep your code in sync with your specification.

üí• Usage of Environmental Effects from [Bow](https://bow-swift.io) to suspend side-effects, and improve their composition and testability.

‚úÖ Enhanced test support for integration or end-to-end test with no mocks.

## üíª Installation

You can install Bow OpenAPI using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/index_es). Its formula is not still in the main repository; therefore, you need to tap it first, before installing it:

```bash
brew tap bow-swift/bow
brew install bow-openapi
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

You can invoke the tool with the following parameters:

```bash
bow-openapi --name <NAME> --schema <YAML | JSON> --output <FOLDER>
```

- `name` is the name for the generated module in the resulting Swift Package. You will have to import it in your code using `import <NAME>`.
- `schema` is the path to the OpenAPI / Swagger specification file. It accepts both YAML or JSON formats.
- `output` is the folder where the result will be saved.
