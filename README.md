**Bow OpenAPI** is a command-line tool to generate a Swift network client from an OpenAPI / Swagger specification file. Please, refer to the [project website](https://openapi.bow-swift.io) for extensive and detailed documentation about the project.

### Features

üí° [Automatic generation](https://openapi.bow-swift.io/docs/generation-examples/basic-generation/) of network clients written in Swift from an OpenAPI / Swagger specification file, in YAML or JSON formats.

üì¶ Provision of a [Swift Package](https://openapi.bow-swift.io/docs/consuming-generated-code/adding-the-module-to-your-project/) that can be consumed from Swift Package Manager.

üî® [Integration with Xcode](https://openapi.bow-swift.io/docs/quick-start/integration-in-xcode/) as a build phase to always keep your code in sync with your specification.

üí• Usage of [Environmental Effects](https://openapi.bow-swift.io/docs/consuming-generated-code/running-a-network-request/) from [Bow](https://bow-swift.io) to suspend side-effects, and improve their composition and testability.

‚úÖ [Enhanced test support](https://openapi.bow-swift.io/docs/consuming-generated-code/testing-your-network-calls/) for integration or end-to-end test with no mocks.

&nbsp;

## Installation guide

Bow OpenAPI is compatible with Unix systems.

### üíª OS X users

You can [install Bow OpenAPI](https://openapi.bow-swift.io/docs/quick-start/installation-guide/) using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/index_es). Its formula is not still in the main repository; therefore, you need to tap it first, before installing it:

```bash
brew tap bow-swift/bow
brew install bow-openapi
```

### üêß Linux users

```bash
curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/bow-swift/bow-openapi/releases/latest \
 | grep -oP '"tag_name": "\K(.*)(?=")' \
 | xargs -I {} wget -O - https://github.com/bow-swift/bow-openapi/archive/{}.tar.gz \
 | tar xz \
 && sudo make linux -C bow-openapi-*
```

> It will install the last stable version.

Bow OpenAPI depends on `Java 8+` and `swagger-codegen`; both will be installed from `Makefile`. After the installation, you can type `bow-openapi -h` in a new termintal to check it.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

You can [invoke the tool](https://openapi.bow-swift.io/docs/quick-start/how-to-run-bow-openapi/) with the following parameters:

```bash
bow-openapi --name <NAME> --schema <YAML | JSON> --output <FOLDER>
```

- `name` is the name for the generated module in the resulting Swift Package. You will have to import it in your code using `import <NAME>`.
- `schema` is the path to the OpenAPI / Swagger specification file. It accepts both YAML or JSON formats.
- `output` is the folder where the result will be saved.
