# Installation guide
 
 Bow OpenAPI is available via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). If you still don't have it installed in your Mac, you can follow the steps in [this link](https://brew.sh/) to set it up.
 
 Once you have it, you need to run the following commands:
 
 ```bash
 brew tap bow-swift/bow
 brew install bow-openapi
 ```
 
 Bow OpenAPI depends on the tool `swagger-codegen`; if you do not have it installed, Homebrew will install this package prior to installing Bow OpenAPI.
